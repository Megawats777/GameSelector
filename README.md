# GameSelector
A application that helps you pick a game to play based on my personal tastes

## Notes
* Currently this program assumes the user is on windows.

    * As of which some functions especially clearConsole() may just flat out not work on non windows platforms

* The version text first displayed is fake and is meant for decoration purposes only.

## Modules
* main.cpp
    * The center piece of the program where user input is performed.

* Game.h and Game.cpp
    * Where the Game class and it's helper functions are stored.

* User.h and User.cpp
    * Where the User class and it's helper functions are stored.

* Utility.h and Utility.cpp
    * A set of generic functions I made that really saved my soul (not really :) ) are stored.
